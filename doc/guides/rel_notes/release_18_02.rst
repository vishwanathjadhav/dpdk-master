New Features
------------

.. This section should contain new features added in this release. Sample
   format:

   * **Add a title in the past tense with a full stop.**

     Add a short 1-2 sentence description in the past tense. The description
     should be enough to allow someone scanning the release notes to
     understand the new feature.

     If the feature adds a lot of sub-features you can use a bullet list like
     this:

     * Added feature foo to do something.
     * Enhanced feature bar to do something else.

     Refer to the previous release notes for examples.

     Also, make sure to start the actual text at the margin.
     =========================================================

* **Add function to allow releasing internal EAL resources on exit**

  During ``rte_eal_init()`` EAL allocates memory from hugepages to enable its
  core libraries to perform their tasks. The ``rte_eal_cleanup()`` function
  releases these resources, ensuring that no hugepage memory is leaked. It is
  expected that all DPDK applications call ``rte_eal_cleanup()`` before
  exiting. Not calling this function could result in leaking hugepages, leading
  to failure during initialization of secondary processes.

* **Added the ixgbe ethernet driver to support RSS with flow API.**

  Rte_flow actually defined to include RSS, but till now, RSS is out of
  rte_flow. This patch is to support igb and ixgbe NIC with existing RSS
  configuration using rte_flow API.

* **Add MAC loopback support for i40e.**

  Add MAC loopback support for i40e in order to support test task asked by
  users. According to the device configuration, it will setup TX->RX loopback
  link or not.

* **Add the support of run time determination of number of queues per i40e VF**

  The number of queue per VF is determined by its host PF. If the PCI address
  of an i40e PF is aaaa:bb.cc, the number of queues per VF can be configured
  with EAL parameter like -w aaaa:bb.cc,queue-num-per-vf=n. The value n can be
  1, 2, 4, 8 or 16. If no such parameter is configured, the number of queues
  per VF is 4 by default.

* **Added the i40e ethernet driver to support RSS with flow API.**

  Rte_flow actually defined to include RSS, but till now, RSS is out of
  rte_flow. This patch is to support i40e NIC with existing RSS
  configuration using rte_flow API.It also enable queue region configuration
  using flow API for i40e.

* **Updated i40e driver to support PPPoE/PPPoL2TP.**

  Updated i40e PMD to support PPPoE/PPPoL2TP with PPPoE/PPPoL2TP supporting
  profiles which can be programmed by dynamic device personalization (DDP)
  process.

* **Added NVGRE and UDP tunnels support in Solarflare network PMD.**

  Added support for NVGRE, VXLAN and GENEVE tunnels.

  * Added support for UDP tunnel ports configuration.
  * Added tunneled packets classification.
  * Added inner checksum offload.

* **Added the igb ethernet driver to support RSS with flow API.**

  Rte_flow actually defined to include RSS, but till now, RSS is out of
  rte_flow. This patch is to support igb NIC with existing RSS configuration
  using rte_flow API.

* **Add AVF (Adaptive Virtual Function) net PMD.**

  A new net PMD has been added, which supports IntelÂ® Ethernet Adaptive
  Virtual Function (AVF) with features list below:

  * Basic Rx/Tx burst
  * SSE vectorized Rx/Tx burst
  * Promiscuous mode
  * MAC/VLAN offload
  * Checksum offload
  * TSO offload
  * Jumbo frame and MTU setting
  * RSS configuration
  * stats
  * Rx/Tx descriptor status
  * Link status update/event

* **Updated the AESNI-MB PMD.**

  The AESNI-MB PMD has been updated with additional support for:

  * AES-CCM algorithm.

* **Updated the DPAA_SEC crypto driver to support rte_security.**

  Updated the ``dpaa_sec`` crypto PMD to support ``rte_security`` lookaside
  protocol offload for IPSec.

* **Added Wireless Base Band Device (bbdev) abstraction.**

  The Wireless Baseband Device library is an acceleration abstraction
  framework for 3gpp Layer 1 processing functions that provides a common
  programming interface for seamless opeartion on integrated or discrete
  hardware accelerators or using optimized software libraries for signal
  processing.
  The current release only supports 3GPP CRC, Turbo Coding and Rate
  Matching operations, as specified in 3GPP TS 36.212.

  See the :doc:`../prog_guide/bbdev` programmer's guide for more details.

* **Added New eventdev OPDL PMD**

  The OPDL (Ordered Packet Distribution Library) eventdev is a specific
  implementation of the eventdev API. It is particularly suited to packet
  processing workloads that have high throughput and low latency requirements.
  All packets follow the same path through the device. The order in which
  packets  follow is determinted by the order in which queues are set up.
  Events are left on the ring until they are transmitted. As a result packets
  do not go out of order.

  With this change, application can use OPDL PMD by eventdev api.

* **Added New pipeline use case for dpdk-test-eventdev application**

  The pipeline case can be used to simulate various stages in a real world
  application from packet receive to transmit while maintaining the packet
  ordering also measure the performance of the event device across the stages
  of the pipeline.

  The pipeline use case has been made generic to work will all the event
  devices based on the capabilities.

* **Updated Eventdev Sample application to support event devices based on capability**

  Updated Eventdev pipeline sample application to support various types of pipelines
  based on the capabilities of the attached event and ethernet devices. Also,
  renamed the application from SW PMD specific ``eventdev_pipeline_sw_pmd``
  to PMD agnostic ``eventdev_pipeline``.

* **Added Rawdev, a generic device support library.**

  Rawdev library provides support for integrating any generic device type with
  DPDK framework. Generic devices are those which do not have a pre-defined
  type within DPDK, for example, ethernet, crypto, event etc.
  A set of northbound APIs have been defined which encompass a generic set of
  operations by allowing applications to interact with device using opaque
  structures/buffers. Also, southbound APIs provide APIs for integrating device
  either as as part of a physical bus (PCI, FSLMC etc) or through ``vdev``.

  See the :doc:`../prog_guide/rawdev` programmer's guide for more details.

* **Added new multi-process communication channel**

  Added a generic channel in EAL for multi-process (primary/secondary) communication.
  Consumers of this channel need to register an action with an action name to response
  a message received; the actions will be identified by the action name and executed
  in the context of a new dedicated thread for this channel. The list of new APIs:

  * ``rte_mp_register`` and ``rte_mp_unregister`` are for action (un)registration.
  * ``rte_mp_sendmsg`` is for sending a message without blocking for a response.
  * ``rte_mp_request`` is for sending a request message and will block until
    it gets a reply message which is sent from the peer by ``rte_mp_reply``.

* **Added new DPDK build system using the tools "meson" and "ninja" [EXPERIMENTAL]**

  Added in support for building DPDK using ``meson`` and ``ninja``, which gives
  additional features, such as automatic build-time configuration, over the
  current build system using ``make``. For instructions on how to do a DPDK build
  using the new system, see the instructions in ``doc/build-sdk-meson.txt``.

.. note::

    This new build system support is incomplete at this point and is added
    as experimental in this release. The existing build system using ``make``
    is unaffected by these changes, and can continue to be used for this
    and subsequent releases until such time as it's deprecation is announced.
